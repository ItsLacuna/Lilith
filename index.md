## Welcome to Lilith's Website! (WIP)

This is the Offical Website for The Lilith Project. A Project ran and maintained by one person that isn't only limited to Discord. 

### What Is Lilith

Lilith currently is a Personalized Discord bot that serves a multipurpose role for moderation, music, fun, game tutorials, and much more!

The Discord Bot and Website are still WIP and will be worked on until completion and further more.

### Why Did You Create Lilith?

Lilith was created as a pet project during summer which then turned into something I do in my free time as I continue to learn Python, Html, and CSS.

### How Do I Use Lilith

Lilith's set prefix currently is **+**,
To get a list of the command Lilith can do ```markdown +help``` will bring up a list of commands.

### How Can I Invite The Bot To My Server?

Its a simple process | [Invite](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=734874312972042250&permissions=8&scope=bot)

```
1. Click on Invite 

2. Pick the Server you want the bot to join

3. Authorize

4. Complete CAPTCHA

```
## What Do You Plan On Doing?
There are several things I plan on doing as its not near completion in terms of goals or finished in general only having the basic commands finished

### Goal #1 - Achieve Multipurpose

The bots main goal is to achieve multipurpose being able to do several things instead of one specifc thing kinda like a jack of all traders but instead of master of none its master of many.

### Goal #2 - Represent Communities

The second goal is to add commands in which communities can personalize the bot to their own liking. Such as Profile Cards, Leveling System and etc. And also show servers/emojis from small communities.

There is much more that I want to do however these are the mean two goals I have planned to complete.
