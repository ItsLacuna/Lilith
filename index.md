<h1 align=center>Welcome to Lilith's Website! (WIP)</h1>
<hr width="60%"/>

<p align=center>This is the Offical Website for The Lilith Project. A Project ran and maintained by one person that isn't only limited to Discord.</p>

<h2 align=center>What Is Lilith?</h2>

<p align=center>Lilith currently is a Personalized Discord bot that serves a multipurpose role for moderation, music, fun, game tutorials, and much more!

The Discord Bot and Website are still WIP and will be worked on until completion and further more.</p>

<h3 align=center>Why Did You Create Lilith?</h3>

<p align=center>Lilith was created as a pet project during summer which then turned into something I do in my free time as I continue to learn Python, Html, and CSS.</p>

<h3 align=center>How Do I Use Lilith</h3>

Lilith's set prefix currently is **+**,
To get a list of the command Lilith can do ``` +help ``` will bring up a list of commands.

### How Can I Invite The Bot To My Server?

<h2 align=center>What Do You Plan On Doing?</h2>
<p align=center>There are several things I plan on doing as its not near completion in terms of goals or finished in general only having the basic commands finished. But I plan on working on this bot for fun until I get bored of it and officially open source it.</p>

<h3 align=center> Goal #1 - Achieve Multipurpose</h3>

<p align=center>The bots main goal is to achieve multipurpose being able to do several things instead of one specifc thing kinda like a jack of all traders but instead of master of none its master of many.</p>

<h3 align=center> Goal #2 - Represent Communities</h3>

<p align=center>The second goal is to add commands in which communities can personalize the bot to their own liking. Such as Profile Cards, Leveling System and etc. And also show servers/emojis from small communities.</p>

There is much more that I want to do however these are the mean two goals I have planned to complete.
